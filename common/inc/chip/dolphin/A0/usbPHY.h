This mode enables the autoresume logic in the PHY, so that the PHY will automatically response to a remote wake-up resume-k from a peripheral, without initial involvement from the host controller. The PHY will respond to a remote wake-up resume-k by driving out its own resume-k. The PHY resume-k will be held until the host controller takes over and configures the PHY to continue driving the resume-k.
